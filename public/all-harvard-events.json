Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain.

Fumiko and Ryotaro&#8217;s prickly relationship is set into relief by their honeymooner niece and new neighbors, whose troubles alternately mirror and refract their own.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Monday, July 7, 2025 Prior to the rise of professional sports in the 20th century, boundaries between sport, theater, and spectacle were blurred. This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Monday, July 7, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

    "description": "CGIS South, 3rd floor 1730 Cambridge St. Cambridge Monday, July 7, 2025, 7am&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;7pm &#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Tuesday, July 8, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Wednesday, July 9, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

Russian occupation of the plant, which would last thirty-five days, had begun. Only the dedication and resolve of Ukrainian personnel, who were held hostage and worked shifts for weeks instead of days, spared the world a new Chernobyl accident. Meanwhile, a much more dangerous situation developed at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the largest such facility in Europe. Following an attack there in March 2022, the Russian military remains in control. In this lecture Serhii Plokhii discusses the challenges that the Russian takeover of the nuclear sites presents to the world. We must face up to a new reality: there has already been warfare at two nuclear sites, and others are vulnerable. The lecture is based on Plokhii&#8217;s most recent book, Chernobyl Roulette (2024).

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.

The featured materials provide viewers an opportunity to think critically and contextualize the often invisible and forgotten histories of Asian and Asian American women in the United States. At the same time, the exhibition examines how race, ethnicity, gender, citizenship, and migration impact the collective memory of a nation through primary sources.

    "description": "Harvard Film Archive 24 Quincy St. Cambridge Sunday, July 13, 2025, 7&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;8:30pm One of Naruse&#8217;s strangest and most riveting films subjects a familiar scenario&#8212;a married couple going through a rough patch&#8212;to a degree of such microscopic scrutiny that it is rendered new and alien. Fumiko and Ryotaro&#8217;s prickly relationship is set into relief by their honeymooner niece and new neighbors, whose troubles alternately mirror and refract their own. Naruse peels back the layers of his characters&#8217; exteriors, finding only self-defeating rationales underneath.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

    "description": "Peabody Museum of Archaeology &amp; Ethnology 11 Divinity Ave Cambridge Monday, July 14, 2025, 9am&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;5pm In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Wednesday, July 16, 2025 Prior to the rise of professional sports in the 20th century, boundaries between sport, theater, and spectacle were blurred. This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Wednesday, July 16, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

    "description": "CGIS-Knafel/North Building 2nd Floor, Room K-262 1737 Cambridge St. Cambridge Wednesday, July 16, 2025, 5&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;6:30pm This talk examines the landscape of accountability in Ukrainian charitable organizations, with a focus on the impact of social media engagement during times of crisis. In Ukraine, 86% of the population has consistently engaged in charitable activities since 2022. In contrast, 64% of Americans made charitable donations in 2023. This high level of charitable engagement in Ukraine is notable, given the urgent need to fund the military and support those affected by the ongoing war. Social media has been extensively utilized for both charity fundraising and reporting/accountability. There&#8217;s a need to understand the dynamic interaction between the charity, its donors, and the broader public, emphasizing the role of dialogic accountability in maintaining transparency and trust. Using the Serhii Prytula Charity Fund as a case study, Dr. Iermolenko will analyze how the emotive power of accounting on social media can help charities foster meaningful conversations, improve decision-making, and ensure effective accountability.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Thursday, July 17, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

It seeks to honor creators whose art and thought enrich our collection, while bringing to light the stories of those whose voices were long overshadowed by colonial histories. A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid. This exhibition was guest curated by Chloe McKain, Class of 2027 and President of the Harvard Caribbean Club.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Friday, July 18, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Monday, July 21, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.

Many countries refused to introduce any measures against the aggressor state. Culture appeared to be the most controversial field, where even the Western democracies, rather unanimous in their response to the Russian assault, failed to achieve any consensus on suitable measures and policies vis-&#224;-vis the rogue state. While virtually nobody questions the need of sanctions against the specific persons and institutions that support the war, the wholesale rejection of Russian culture and cancelling of its iconic figures is often vehemently denied. The lecture will delve into the essence of these debates, trying to answer a fundamental question: To what degree and in which way a seemingly innocent, apolitical cultural &#8216;soft power&#8217; contributes to the militant &#8216;hard power&#8217; of the aggressor state during the war.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Thursday, July 24, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It seeks to honor creators whose art and thought enrich our collection, while bringing to light the stories of those whose voices were long overshadowed by colonial histories. A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid. This exhibition was guest curated by Chloe McKain, Class of 2027 and President of the Harvard Caribbean Club.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Friday, July 25, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Wednesday, July 30, 2025 Prior to the rise of professional sports in the 20th century, boundaries between sport, theater, and spectacle were blurred. This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment. This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Wednesday, July 30, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

Dr. Emily Channell-Justice will describe the process of developing her current research on internal displacement in Ukraine since 2014, which was then disrupted by the full-scale invasion. She will discuss data sources and pose questions about ethical research during ongoing hostilities. The lecture will also explore the possibilities of collaborative work that may strengthen the research process and improve its conclusions. The discussion will focus on the main data set: 80 interviews with internally displaced Ukrainians from Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea, collected by a Ukrainian anthropologist between 2014 and 2016 and given to Dr. Channell-Justice to use for research. Dr. Channell-Justice will describe what these interviews reveal about the experience of displacement and doing research when circumstances do not allow for normal ethnographic data collection through long-term participant observation.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Thursday, July 31, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.

Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Monday, August 4, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Tuesday, August 5, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment. This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.

It seeks to honor creators whose art and thought enrich our collection, while bringing to light the stories of those whose voices were long overshadowed by colonial histories. A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Wednesday, August 6, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

The featured materials provide viewers an opportunity to think critically and contextualize the often invisible and forgotten histories of Asian and Asian American women in the United States. At the same time, the exhibition examines how race, ethnicity, gender, citizenship, and migration impact the collective memory of a nation through primary sources.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Friday, August 8, 2025 Prior to the rise of professional sports in the 20th century, boundaries between sport, theater, and spectacle were blurred. This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment. This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Friday, August 8, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world. In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Friday, August 15, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

    "description": "Peabody Museum of Archaeology &amp; Ethnology 11 Divinity Ave Cambridge Sunday, August 17, 2025, 9am&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;5pm In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives. TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Monday, August 18, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Wednesday, August 20, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective.

Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain.

It seeks to honor creators whose art and thought enrich our collection, while bringing to light the stories of those whose voices were long overshadowed by colonial histories. A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid. This exhibition was guest curated by Chloe McKain, Class of 2027 and President of the Harvard Caribbean Club.

    "description": "CGIS South, 3rd floor 1730 Cambridge St. Cambridge Friday, August 22, 2025, 7am&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;7pm &#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes. The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain.

    "description": "Houghton Library Harvard Yard Cambridge Thursday, August 28, 2025 2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.
