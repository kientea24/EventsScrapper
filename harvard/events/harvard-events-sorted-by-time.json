It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

    "location": "CGIS South, 3rd floor1730 Cambridge St.Cambridge Tuesday, July 15, 2025, 7am&nbsp;–&nbsp;7pm “The Things They Shared” is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian’s ongoing project, “Fieldwork.” It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

In Ukraine, 86% of the population has consistently engaged in charitable activities since 2022. In contrast, 64% of Americans made charitable donations in 2023. This high level of charitable engagement in Ukraine is notable, given the urgent need to fund the military and support those affected by the ongoing war. Social media has been extensively utilized for both charity fundraising and reporting/accountability. There’s a need to understand the dynamic interaction between the charity, its donors, and the broader public, emphasizing the role of dialogic accountability in maintaining transparency and trust. Using the Serhii Prytula Charity Fund as a case study, Dr. Iermolenko will analyze how the emotive power of accounting on social media can help charities foster meaningful conversations, improve decision-making, and ensure effective accountability.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives.

Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

She will discuss data sources and pose questions about ethical research during ongoing hostilities. The lecture will also explore the possibilities of collaborative work that may strengthen the research process and improve its conclusions. The discussion will focus on the main data set: 80 interviews with internally displaced Ukrainians from Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea, collected by a Ukrainian anthropologist between 2014 and 2016 and given to Dr. Channell-Justice to use for research.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and “natural” landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.
