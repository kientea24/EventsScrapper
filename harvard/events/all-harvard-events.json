It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

In Ukraine, 86% of the population has consistently engaged in charitable activities since 2022. In contrast, 64% of Americans made charitable donations in 2023. This high level of charitable engagement in Ukraine is notable, given the urgent need to fund the military and support those affected by the ongoing war. Social media has been extensively utilized for both charity fundraising and reporting/accountability. There’s a need to understand the dynamic interaction between the charity, its donors, and the broader public, emphasizing the role of dialogic accountability in maintaining transparency and trust. Using the Serhii Prytula Charity Fund as a case study, Dr. Iermolenko will analyze how the emotive power of accounting on social media can help charities foster meaningful conversations, improve decision-making, and ensure effective accountability.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

    "description": "CGIS South, 3rd floor1730 Cambridge St.Cambridge Thursday, July 17, 2025, 7am&nbsp;–&nbsp;7pm “The Things They Shared” is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian’s ongoing project, “Fieldwork.” It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

The featured materials provide viewers an opportunity to think critically and contextualize the often invisible and forgotten histories of Asian and Asian American women in the United States. At the same time, the exhibition examines how race, ethnicity, gender, citizenship, and migration impact the collective memory of a nation through primary sources.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the “New World.” Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what—and who—was measured, and how.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

    "location": "CGIS South, 3rd floor1730 Cambridge St.Cambridge Friday, August 22, 2025, 7am&nbsp;–&nbsp;7pm “The Things They Shared” is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian’s ongoing project, “Fieldwork.” It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives.

Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective.

It also responds to representational histories — miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. Karapetian’s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography’s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.
