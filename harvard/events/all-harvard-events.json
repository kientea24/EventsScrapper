    "description": "Prior to the rise of professional sports in the 20th century, boundaries between sport, theater, and spectacle were blurred. This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve—themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment. This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric \"pages\" woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In \"Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,\" Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",
