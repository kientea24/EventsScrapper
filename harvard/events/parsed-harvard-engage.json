The group will then reconvene at 2:15 p.m. to share progress, troubleshoot as needed, and set goals for the rest of the day. Participants are also encouraged to share wins, challenges, and strategies for success.\n \nMeets from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. every weekday from July 14 through July 25.  Register in advance through the Academic Resource Center Scheduler.\nUpon registration, you will receive an email with Zoom links for each day.\n \nDaily attendance is suggested for group accountability.
