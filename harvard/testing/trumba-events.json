    "description": "Prior to the rise of professional sports in the 20th century, boundaries between sport, theater, and spectacle were blurred. This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "title": "The Punched Card from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age",
    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "title": "The Punched Card from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age",
    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "Today, measurement is everywhere. We understand everything around us in inches, degrees, gallons, decibels, and more. But measurements are human inventions. It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

The architect/builder Ivan Levynskyi was a fundamental actor during that era in creating a Lviv that was aesthetically captivating and culturally significant. Levynskyi&#8217;s work helped to shape an urban model of elegant density, propinquity, and architectural heterogeneity.<br /><br />This &#8220;city symphony&#8221; film, accompanied by a lecture and discussion, traces a remarkable life and legacy that ended tragically during the violent aftermath of the First World War and offers not only compelling visuals of Lviv&#8217;s splendid architectural heritage, but also provocative reflections by city residents, scholars, and other observers on memory, identity, and the politics of place-making.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "title": "The Punched Card from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age",
    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "title": "The Punched Card from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age",
    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain.

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

    "description": "On February 24, 2022, the first day of Russia&#8217;s all-out attack on Ukraine, armored vehicles approached the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Russian occupation of the plant, which would last thirty-five days, had begun. Only the dedication and resolve of Ukrainian personnel, who were held hostage and worked shifts for weeks instead of days, spared the world a new Chernobyl accident. Meanwhile, a much more dangerous situation developed at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the largest such facility in Europe. Following an attack there in March 2022, the Russian military remains in control. In this lecture Serhii Plokhii discusses the challenges that the Russian takeover of the nuclear sites presents to the world. We must face up to a new reality: there has already been warfare at two nuclear sites, and others are vulnerable. The lecture is based on Plokhii&#8217;s most recent book, Chernobyl Roulette (2024).",

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Takamine plays Shima, a lower-class woman of mysterious origin who realizes after a string of nosediving relationships with cruel and unremarkable men that her greatest power is her own resolve.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "This talk examines the landscape of accountability in Ukrainian charitable organizations, with a focus on the impact of social media engagement during times of crisis. In Ukraine, 86% of the population has consistently engaged in charitable activities since 2022. In contrast, 64% of Americans made charitable donations in 2023. This high level of charitable engagement in Ukraine is notable, given the urgent need to fund the military and support those affected by the ongoing war. Social media has been extensively utilized for both charity fundraising and reporting/accountability. There&#8217;s a need to understand the dynamic interaction between the charity, its donors, and the broader public, emphasizing the role of dialogic accountability in maintaining transparency and trust. Using the Serhii Prytula Charity Fund as a case study, Dr. Iermolenko will analyze how the emotive power of accounting on social media can help charities foster meaningful conversations, improve decision-making, and ensure effective accountability.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

It seeks to honor creators whose art and thought enrich our collection, while bringing to light the stories of those whose voices were long overshadowed by colonial histories. A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid. <br /><br />This exhibition was guest curated by Chloe McKain, Class of 2027 and President of the Harvard Caribbean Club.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "title": "The Punched Card from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age",
    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It seeks to honor creators whose art and thought enrich our collection, while bringing to light the stories of those whose voices were long overshadowed by colonial histories. A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid. <br /><br />This exhibition was guest curated by Chloe McKain, Class of 2027 and President of the Harvard Caribbean Club.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "title": "When Soft Power Turns Hard: Cancel-Culture Controversy During the Russian-Ukrainian War",
    "description": "Russian aggression against Ukraine evoked nearly universal international condemnation but got much less unanimous response in more practical terms of political, economic, and other sanctions. Many countries refused to introduce any measures against the aggressor state. Culture appeared to be the most controversial field, where even the Western democracies, rather unanimous in their response to the Russian assault, failed to achieve any consensus on suitable measures and policies vis-&#224;-vis the rogue state. While virtually nobody questions the need of sanctions against the specific persons and institutions that support the war, the wholesale rejection of Russian culture and cancelling of its iconic figures is often vehemently denied. The lecture will delve into the essence of these debates, trying to answer a fundamental question: To what degree and in which way a seemingly innocent, apolitical cultural &#8216;soft power&#8217; contributes to the militant &#8216;hard power&#8217; of the aggressor state during the war.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "title": "The Punched Card from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age",
    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "Prior to the rise of professional sports in the 20th century, boundaries between sport, theater, and spectacle were blurred. This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid. <br /><br />This exhibition was guest curated by Chloe McKain, Class of 2027 and President of the Harvard Caribbean Club.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Dr. Emily Channell-Justice will describe the process of developing her current research on internal displacement in Ukraine since 2014, which was then disrupted by the full-scale invasion. She will discuss data sources and pose questions about ethical research during ongoing hostilities. The lecture will also explore the possibilities of collaborative work that may strengthen the research process and improve its conclusions. The discussion will focus on the main data set: 80 interviews with internally displaced Ukrainians from Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea, collected by a Ukrainian anthropologist between 2014 and 2016 and given to Dr. Channell-Justice to use for research. Dr. Channell-Justice will describe what these interviews reveal about the experience of displacement and doing research when circumstances do not allow for normal ethnographic data collection through long-term participant observation.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

The featured materials provide viewers an opportunity to think critically and contextualize the often invisible and forgotten histories of Asian and Asian American women in the United States. At the same time, the exhibition examines how race, ethnicity, gender, citizenship, and migration impact the collective memory of a nation through primary sources.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

This exhibit explores sports as a mode of performance and entertainment. What connects outstanding athletes across time are attributes such as strength, balance, and nerve&#8212;themes around which this exhibition is organized. Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Athletic stars of yesteryear left an extraordinary legacy in the form of prints, photographs, and other ephemera, and these materials underscore how the appeal of modern sports was built on a shared foundation of skilled athleticism and sensational entertainment.<br /><br />This exhibition was co-curated by Matthew Wittmann and Karintha Lowe of the Harvard Theatre Collection.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

The featured materials provide viewers an opportunity to think critically and contextualize the often invisible and forgotten histories of Asian and Asian American women in the United States. At the same time, the exhibition examines how race, ethnicity, gender, citizenship, and migration impact the collective memory of a nation through primary sources.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It is through measures that we learn to see difference, to compare the world.<br /><br />In the Americas, colonial powers introduced new measurements to describe and exploit the &#8220;New World.&#8221; Existing ways of understanding and explaining the world and our relationship to others were displaced, cementing European measures as norms and tools of authority. Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Using examples from across the Americas, this exhibit illustrates what&#8212;and who&#8212;was measured, and how.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "title": "The Punched Card from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age",
    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It seeks to honor creators whose art and thought enrich our collection, while bringing to light the stories of those whose voices were long overshadowed by colonial histories. A variety of Caribbean materials can be found at Houghton, ranging from an early map of the region, a document signed by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture, and a manuscript by renowned Antiguan-American author Jamaica Kincaid. <br /><br />This exhibition was guest curated by Chloe McKain, Class of 2027 and President of the Harvard Caribbean Club.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies.

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "2025 marks the 300th anniversary of a technology associated with the computer age, but with roots in the Industrial Revolution. In 1725, French silk weaver Basile Bouchon invented the use of a paper tape with punched holes to automate the work of a loom. By the 19th century, punchcard-controlled looms produced sophisticated textiles, including fabric &quot;pages&quot; woven from silk to simulate the leaves of a medieval manuscript. Computing pioneer Charles Babbage first envisioned adapting punched cards to computing; in the early computer age, they were the primary means for data entry and processing. In &quot;Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation,&quot; Wallace Eckert shared his work using punched cards to perform complex calculations such as determining the orbits of planets.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

    "description": "&#8220;The Things They Shared&#8221; is an excerpt from Farrah Karapetian&#8217;s ongoing project, &#8220;Fieldwork.&#8221; It delves into the lives of cotton field workers in Uzbekistan, exploring their relationships with community, governance, subordination, personal freedom, and the natural and social environments they navigate. It also responds to representational histories &#8212; miming anthropological typology and the documentary photograph but privileging the personal experience of the worker rather than institutional narratives. <br /><br />Karapetian&#8217;s artistic approach is as integral to her message as is the subject matter itself. Cyanotype is one of photography&#8217;s original processes and requires only sun and water for its exposure and development, a priority in the context of industrially irrigated cotton fields that impact water ecologies. She uses a spray gun to deploy the cyanotype emulsion onto cotton rag substrate so as to clarify her voice, rather than purport to be objective. The cyanotype technique allows her to infuse softness into her photographic collages, creating layered, abstract images that speak directly to the essence of her subjects: cotton, the field, water, the sun, and the human touch.",

Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain.

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",

At this research-a-thon, we&#39;ll be investigating and identifying the dates associated with the buttons of candidates who have run for all levels of political office. Identifying these dates will make it much easier for people to find specific buttons in the collection, enabling more robust research. Plus, you&#8217;ll get to explore the many political campaigns run over the past century &#8211; just in time for you to get out to your city&#39;s polls next month!",

    "description": "Ahead of state and local elections this November, join HKS and Harvard Libraries for a civically engaged copyright-a-thon on the Political Buttons at HKS Collection!<br /><br />The Political Buttons at HKS Collection features nearly 3,000 buttons representing U.S. political history from 1904 through today. At this copyright-a-thon, we&#39;ll be investigating the copyright status associated with the buttons of candidates who have run for all levels of political office. Identifying their copyright status will enable us to make the buttons available on many more platforms beyond Harvard, increasing the collection&#8217;s reach and research potential. You&#8217;ll learn about copyright law, practice one method for checking a work&#8217;s copyright status, and explore the many political campaigns run over the past century &#8211; just in time for you to get out to your city&#39;s polls next month!",

Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition.

    "description": "In this exhibition, the art collective TRES invites us to share their 2016 journey to document, collect, and photograph debris along the beaches of Australia. Evoking archaeology, marine biology, and cartography, their images summon us to more deeply engage with the natural vistas and objects they have encountered, and to examine and interpret them with fresh perspectives.<br /><br />TRES transports us with photographs of glowing orbs that resemble celestial spheres more than the bottle caps they once were. Making their way as garbage to Australia from as far away as China, these objects have been scarred by Bryozoa, tiny micro-organisms which can be seen in the display case in this exhibition. Now, plastic items such as these lay scattered about the otherwise pristine-appearing landscapes.<br /><br />The rhythmic flow of images challenges us to make sense of the terrain. With hand-drawn maps and charts, TRES attempts to bring order to a perplexing world, where plastic objects resemble organic ones, and &#8220;natural&#8221; landscapes bear unmistakable traces of human-made pollution.",
